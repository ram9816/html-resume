    <h1>Ryan's Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Web Development</h2>
    <p>Ryan has been learning web development in his free time to make tools for his field of work. His hope is that one day he will make tools for the theater industry that are accessibly priced, as most pieces of software currently in use are expensive given the pay structure of theater.</p>

    <h2>Powerlifting</h2>
    <p>Ryan enjoys powerlifiting training, though he is unsure if he will ever compete.</p>

    <h2>Dogwatching</h2>
    <p>Ryan always has a sharp eye out to see great dogs in the area.</p>

    <h2>Choosing Workplace Snacks</h2>
    <p>Ryan always has A+ snacks with him at work (yes he shares).</p>
